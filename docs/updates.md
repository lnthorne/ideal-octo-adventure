# Progress Updates

### Aug 21, 2024

- Very rough draft of what needs to be done for the homeowner
- Current user flow: welcome -> login/signup -> (tabs) home, create post, logout
- What needs to be done next: Need to create a seperate user for companies, they need their own login after the welcome page, their own homescreen and be able to view the posts from the homeowner.

### Aug 22, 2024

- Created two sets of users, homeowner and companyowner
- Note: When logging out of either homeowner or companyowner, you are brought directly back to the wolcome page. The user is null and thus the user type is null. Figure out a way when logging out you stay in the right path
- The companyowner can now view posts and bid on the posts
- What needs to be done next: The homeowner should be able to look at their open job postings and see the bids that have been made. The homeowner can then decline or accpet the bids. The companyowner can view past bids and current open bids
