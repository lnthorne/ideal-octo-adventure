# Progress Updates

### Aug 21, 2024

- Very rough draft of what needs to be done for the homeowner
- Current user flow: welcome -> login/signup -> (tabs) home, create post, logout
- What needs to be done next: Need to create a seperate user for companies, they need their own login after the welcome page, their own homescreen and be able to view the posts from the homeowner.

### Aug 22, 2024

- Created two sets of users, homeowner and companyowner
- Note: When logging out of either homeowner or companyowner, you are brought directly back to the wolcome page. The user is null and thus the user type is null. Figure out a way when logging out you stay in the right path
- The companyowner can now view posts and bid on the posts
