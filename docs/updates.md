# Progress Updates

### Aug 21, 2024

- Very rough draft of what needs to be done for the homeowner
- Current user flow: welcome -> login/signup -> (tabs) home, create post, logout
- What needs to be done next: Need to create a seperate user for companies, they need their own login after the welcome page, their own homescreen and be able to view the posts from the homeowner.
